Project
======

### **Project Description** ###
This is a Python and Data Centric based Project.<br>
The purpose of this project is to showcase the knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB and Heroku I gained so far in this course and give users the possibility to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their own content and data (CRUD) on and with this web application.

Project Requirements:<br>
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB, Heroku

### **Project Goals** ###
- To build something awesome to be proud of
- To make effective use of course knowledge and fulfill all given requirements
- To make a project with a great looking layout, that works and that is practical
- To create a web application that makes the user want to stay and use with pleasure

- to use the CRUD features for this app to interaction with the MongoDB database management system.

**Create** - or upload a data into the database which can then be viewed by all other registered users.

**Read** - or view all the data on the web application, which is stored in the database.
The data can be filtered by keywords of the users choice.

**Update,** - change or add additional information of their own data stored in the database within the limits of the input form.

**Delete** - their own data stored in the database. This functionality is NOT extended to other user's data.
The website has been designed with a basic level of security
In order to prevent unwanted editing or deleting data of other user's data.

### **Website Description** ###
CookBook is a (fictitious) easy to use and interactive designed website to provide user's with a choice of recipes. 

Some of the features to guarantee a easy use and good review are a search functionality and a limited number of recipe per page with a pagination at the bottom of the page to rids the need to endless scrolling.<br> 
All users have access to articles, social media contacts, conditions, general terms and other contact informations and they can subscribe to a newsletter. 

Registered users have a account with a profile page with a list of all marked favourite recipes, a list of all added recipes and the possibility to change the password.  They can share, edit and delete recipes.

Please note: This is only to simulate an affiliate marketing business model for educational purposes and in no way endorses or implies a business relationship with the chosen retailers.

### **Website Owner's Goals** ###
- To build awareness of the brand
- To promote a brand of cooking tools
- To increase traffic to the site and in turn increase registration
- To provide simple easy sign up process to enable users to register
- To provide easy and simple to understandable information on recipes
- To be visually striking to catch attention and provoke curiosity to explore the page
- To encourage advertisers to place their ads on the page for untensils and other cooking items 
- To opening up more opportunities for more recipes, engagement, special offers and expansion of the site
- To get users to be able to engage by uploading their own thus making it a creative and user driven platform

Design
======

### **Colours** ###
I find inspiration for colour schemes on [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).
The website has a simple light color scheme, with some darker colours to set contrasts. This gives some separation without overpowering the layout in combination with the colorful pictures of the recipes.

![Colour palette](Documentation/colours/colour-palette.png)
â€‹

BODY & NAVBAR
- *Floral White* (#FEF9EF)

FOOTER
- *Lavender Web* (#E3DFFF)

TEXT
- *Smoky Black* (#0F0A0A)
- *Dim Gray* (#6D6A75)
- *Lavender Web* (#E3DFFF)

BUTTON
- *Ruby Red* (#9A031E)
- *Dim Gray* (#6D6A75)

COLOUR ACCENTS
- *Ruby Red* (#9A031E)
- *Dim Gray* (#6D6A75)
- *Lavender Web* (#E3DFFF)
- *Floral White* (#FEF9EF)

### **Typography** ###
I've chosen fonts that complement eachother using a combination of serif and sans-serif fonts.

The chosed fonts are [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?standard-styles=&query=Comfortaa) for the headings and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?standard-styles=&query=mon) for the body text.

The font for the content Logo was created using [Arial Rounded MT Bold](https://docs.microsoft.com/sv-se/typography/font-list/arial-rounded-mt) to give it a rounded harmonic look.

### **Imagery** ###
<img src="Documentation/imagery/CookHat.svg">
<img src="Documentation/imagery/CookBook.svg"><br>

A simple and good recognisable Icon and Logo/Brand, designed and created by the developer with [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/roadmap.html).

### **Responsive Front-end Design** ###
Responsive mobile first design using the Bootstrap framework.
Jinja2 templating framework for Python is used to create the site's front-end dynamic content.

### **Back-end Design** ###
The app is created using Python3 and a Flask framework to render the HTML pages.
The site is deployed via a Heroku app linked to a GitHub repository.
The dynamic content is served utilising a MongoDB document based database.

Deployment
======

The website was developed using *Gitpod* and using *Git* pushed to *GitHub*, which hosts the repository. I made the following steps to deploy the site using *Heroku*:

### **Cloning milestone-project-3 from GitHub** ###
### Prerequisites ###
Ensure the following are installed locally on your computer:
- [Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [PIP3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) Python package installer
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Version Control

### Cloning the GitHub repository ###
- Navigate to **Puksrevolution/milestone-project-3**
- Click the **Code** button
- **Copy** the url in the dropdown box
- Using your favourite **IDE** open up your preferred terminal
- **Navigate** to your desired file location

Copy the following code and input it into your terminal to clone the milestone-project-3:

```
git clone https://github.com/Puksrevolution/milestone-project-3.git
```

### Creation of a Python Virtual Environment ###
*Note: The process may be different depending upon your own OS - please follow this [Python help guide](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/venv.html)
to understand how to create a virtual environment*

### Install the App dependencies and external libraries ###
- In your IDE terminal window, install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file with the following command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create the database in MongoDB ###
*Please ensure you have an account created at [MongoDB](https://account.mongodb.com/) in order to build the database*

- In your MongoDB cluster, create a new database called `cook_book`
- Create the following collections within the new database:
  - [newsletter](Documentation/database/newsletter.json)
  - [products](Documentation/database/products.json)
  - [recipes](Documentation/database/recipes.json)
  - [users](Documentation/database/users.json)  

### Create `env.py` file ###
- The `env.py` file should contain at least the following information:

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "YOUR_OWN_SECRET_KEY")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "YOUR_OWN_MONGODB_URI")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "YOUR_OWN_MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME")
```

- Please ensure you add in your own `SECRET_KEY`, `MONGO_URI` and `MONGO_DBNAME` values.
- ***Important:*** Add the `env.py` file to your `.gitignore` file before pushing your files to any public git repository.

### Run the application ###
- To run the application enter the following command into the terminal window:

```
python3 app.py
```

### **Deploying milestone-project-3 app to Heroku** ###
### Create the Heroku App ###
*Please ensure you have an account created at [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/login) in order to deploy the app*

- Log in to your Heroku account dashboard and create a new app.
- Enter the App name. 
  - This needs to be unique and ... is already in use so choose a suitable alternative name for your own App.
- Choose a geographical region closest to where you live.
  - Options available on a free account are ***United States*** or ***Europe***


### Push your repository to GitHub ###
- Commit and push your local repository to your GitHub linked repsitory
- Ensure your local git repository has the following files in the root directory:

  - Heroku `Procfile`
  - `requirements.txt`

- If these are not showing in your local Git repository for any reason, enter the following commands in the terminal window:

```
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
- Stage, commit and push your local Git repository to GitHub

### Connect Heroku to GitHub ###
- In the Heroku App Settings page, open the section Config Vars
- Add all the environmant variables from your local `env.py` file into the Heroku Config Vars:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| IP | 0.0.0.0 |
| PORT | 5000 |
| SECRET_KEY | YOUR_OWN_SECRET_KEY |
| MONGO_URI | YOUR_OWN_MONGODB_URI |
| MONGO_DBNAME | YOUR_OWN_MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME |

- In the Heroku App Deploy page: 
  - Select GitHub from the Deployment Method options.
  - Select Connect to GitHub.
  - Log in to your GitHub account from Heroku to link the App to GitHub.
  - Search for and select the repository to be linked in Github.
